This section shows how the notions of jump-diffusions explained in Appendix \ref{jump-diffusions} apply in the affine case.
These results are useful because---as we see in Theorem \ref{theorem:affine-regularity}---affine processes are affine jump-diffusions.
Throughout this section, we take $\X$ to be an affine jump-diffusion with differential $\trunc$-characteristics $(\affDrift^\trunc, \affDiff, \affJump)$, but \emph{do not necessarily} assume $\X$ is an affine process, in the sense of Definition \ref{definition:affine-process}.
Firstly, we prove the uniform-boundedness property for the affine jump kernel $\affJump$.

With this result, we can state succinct versions of the results which exist for general jump-diffusions.
The first of which can be seen as our \emph{escape hatch} to representing affine processes $\X$ as objects subject to a dynamical system $\dot\pathVar = \affDrift(\pathVar)$, subject to both continuous and purely-discontinuous martingale noise.

Now that we have results on affine jump-diffusions, the question arises if they are affine processes in the sense of our Definition \ref{definition:affine-process}.
The answer is \emph{yes}, so long as the associated differential $\trunc$-characteristics $(\affDrift^\trunc, \affDiff, \affJump)$ and subsequent L\'evy-Khintchine map have an associated solution to (\ref{eq:complex-riccati-system}).
