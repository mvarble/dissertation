% discuss how contraction maps allow for state-dependent processes
While Mogulskii's theorem specifies that the processes $(Y^\epsilon)_{\epsilon>0}$---by design---have independent increments, we may use the contraction principle \cite[Theorem 4.2.1]{dembo2010} to develop a large deviation principle for families of processes with state-dependent increments.
Indeed, by introducing a continuous map $F$, we will have a large deviation principle for the family $(\push{\Prb^\epsilon}{F})_{\epsilon>0}$ of measures $\push{\Prb^\epsilon}{F}$ associated with respective quantities $F(Y^\epsilon)$, and $F$ can be chosen so that each $F(Y^\epsilon)$ is a process with state-dependent increments.
Seeing as this section serves as a survey for intuition on rate functions, we will digress from discussing the specifics of continuity of $F$ on restricted spaces and/or exponentially equivalent families in our examples below.
