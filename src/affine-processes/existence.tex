% discuss how we intend to talk about \ode
This elaborates upon the extension of the transform formula in (\ref{eq:affine-definition}) and dynamics in (\ref{eq:riccati-system-bounded}) to real moments $\momentVar \in \vecSpace$. 
Clearly, should any extension exist for some $\momentVar \in \vecSpace$, the value $\ode(\momentVar, \stateVar) = \dot\aff(0,\momentVar,\stateVar)$ should be well-defined.
That said, we henceforth denote the following set.
\begin{equation*}
  \odeSpace \defeq \Big\{ \momentVar \in \vecSpace : \ode(\momentVar, \stateVar) \text{ is well-defined for all } \stateVar \in \stateSpace \Big\}
\end{equation*}
Quick inspection of $\ode(\momentVar, \stateVar)$ in (\ref{eq:affine-maps}) indicates that well-definition should depend solely on the integral term.
The following results will perform the careful analysis to show that $\ode$ has nice regularity on the finite moments of its associated jump kernel $\affJump(\cdot,\rmd\markVar)$.

% discuss the nature of \aff
Now that we have elaborated upon the relevant results of $\ode$ as a scalar field, we proceed to show the existence of a solutions to the dynamical system it imposes.
These tighly coincide with the moments of our affine process.

% discuss how we want to know the nature of \aff and \momentSpace
Now that we have two characterizations for the space $\momentSpace$, we seek to understand properties of it and the associated moment map $\aff: \momentSpace \times \stateSpace \rightarrow \bbR$.
