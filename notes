THESIS: first draft with following shape
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Technical issues surrounding affine processes
  - affine transform formula (purely complex moments)
  - Cuchiero hammer (now alpha, beta, mu "refer to appendix for blah")
  - ode (Keller-Ressel)
  - "light-tails" assumption (Lambda, ode simplified)
  - continue with the epsilon difficulty

2. LDP
  - almost all the same (move the affine stuff)

3. Examples/applications
  - piecewise psi-map
  - "ripping off" KK is good + jumps + Hawkes
  - plots
  - no need for excessive details
  - can take stuff from exact sampling paper (without explicit details)
  - i.e. "future work"
  - Duffy time-change: "look at alternative approach!"

A. jump diffusions
  - semimartingales
  - measure changes
  - stochastic exponentials
  - truncations

---------------------------------------------------------
DEFENSE: get things moving next week; scratchy slides
---------------------------------------------------------

Top ideas:
  - Survey of large deviations (10 minutes)
    - epsilon log asymptotic
    - definition
    - Chebyshev: change measure with exp(----), pull out (gives tools for later)
    - reading list (DZ+KF+Puhalskii) + strengths of each reference
  - What is an affine process? (10 minutes)
    - approaches to stochastic processes (transition, ito, feller): what affine means in each case
    - what is (generally) known/unknown (kicker: no ldp)
  - Main theorem + discussion with examples (10 minutes)
    - State theorem, explain.
    - proof approaches (DZ fdds, KF skorkhod stuff, puhalskii representation)
  - Equivalence theorem (10 minutes)
    - "fun fact we found in proof" = equivalence of approaches
    - recall exponential from LDP
    - twist
    - martingale
    - equivalence
    - Z = L equality
    - ideas on where this might generally apply

Extra: maybe put slides for something to point at when talking technical

MORE NOTES:
---------------------------------------------------------

- Results page: bold DG

- Puhalskii analogy
  - left Prokhorov + convergence of fdds
  - right LDP fdd+exponential tightness

- DG measures:
  - abstract fdd (no increment)
  - abstract rate function
  - no saddlpoint

- Exponential martingales

- Pros+Cons
  - Increments
    - more generality
    - bad rate functions
  - Martingales
    - more interpretable
    - technically challenging; difficult to generalize
