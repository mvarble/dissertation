This section proves our large deviation principle from a perspective similar to that of Dawson-G\"artner (see \cite[]{dembo2010}), in which we prove the principle for the finite-dimensional projections, so that we get a principle on the projective space associated with $\pathSpace{[0,\infty)}{\stateSpace}$ that we may tighten to the Skorokhod space through exponential tightness.
Though we attribute this approach to the names of Dawson and G\"artner, we specifically use results in \cite{feng2006} which instead use results which appeal more to Prohorov-like arguments of weak convergence on an exponential scale.
In any case, we start with proving the principle on the finite-dimensional projections.
