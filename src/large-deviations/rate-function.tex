% discuss how we intend to get integral form of rate function
So far, for each $\stateVar \in \stateSpace^\circ$, Theorem \ref{theorem:ldp} provides us a large deviation principle for $(\Prb^\epsilon_\stateVar)_{\epsilon>0}$ with good rate function $\rf_\stateVar$ as in (\ref{eq:rf}).
This section is concerned with simplifying the nature of $\rf_\stateVar$ to take a more explicit integral form, comparable to existing principles for other families of stochastic processes.
\begin{equation*}
  \rf_\stateVar(\pathVar) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    \displaystyle \int_0^\infty \ode^*\big(\dot\pathVar(t), \pathVar(t)\big) \rmd t & \pathVar(0) = \stateVar, ~ \pathVar \in \acpathSpace{[0,\infty)}{\stateSpace} \\
    \infty & \text{otherwise}
  \end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}
To show this, we start by defining a map $\rf$ which composes the initial state through our rate functions $(\rf_\stateVar)_{\stateVar\in\stateSpace}$, to remove the finiteness condition of each $\rf_\stateVar$ in (\ref{eq:rf}).
\begin{equation*}
  \rf(\pathVar) \defeq \rf_{\pathVar(0)}(\pathVar) = \sup_{\underline t \vdash \Delta_\pathVar^c} \aff^*\big(\underline t, \pathVar(\underline t), \pathVar(0) \big)
\end{equation*}
In the following results, we will--without mention--assume evaluations of $\rf(\pathVar)$ for $\pathVar(0) \in \stateSpace^\circ$, so that we can use Theorem \ref{theorem:mgf-fdds}.
Note that this is at no loss of generality, since we are resolving our rate function $\rf_\stateVar$ for a large deviation principle that already requires $\stateVar \in \stateSpace^\circ$.
