We have now gathered enough familiarity with rate functions that appear in the large deviations literature and the various tools we may use to lift existing principles to new ones.
This will allow us to more easily understand the nature and derivation of our semi-closed form for (\ref{eq:rf-integral}) in Theorem \ref{theorem:ldp-integral}.
Let us now elaborate on the family on which we derive our semi-closed form.

Firstly, in order for us to perform the tricks of coupling we explored in the previous section, we need to couple our arrivals and/or accumulated jumps.
We will need these objects to be locally integrable, so we impose that our base process $\X$ is \emph{locally countable} in the sense of our definition in Appendix \ref{jump-diffusions:countable}.
In particular, suppose that our base process $\X$ has special differential characteristics $(\affDrift, \affDiff, \affJump)$, where $\affJump$ has the finiteness condition below.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:assumption-affJump-finite}
  \affJump(\stateVar, \vecSpace) < \infty, \quad \stateVar \in \stateSpace
\end{equation}
Note that Proposition \ref{proposition:locally-countable} thus provides us with a factoring 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:affJump-factoring}
  \affJump(\stateVar,\rmd\markVar) = \affInt(\stateVar) \affDist(\stateVar, \rmd\markVar)
\end{equation}
into an intensity function $\affInt \in \scrB(\stateSpace)/\scrB(\bbR_+)$ and conditional jump distribution $\affDist$ from $(\stateSpace, \scrB(\stateSpace))$ to $(\vecSpace, \scrB(\vecSpace))$.
Denote to each $\affJump(\stateVar, \cdot)$ the notation from Sections \ref{rate-functions:mogulskii} and \ref{rate-functions:coupling}.
\begin{equation*}
  \overline{\affDist(\stateVar, \cdot)} \defeq \int_\vecSpace \markVar \affDist(\stateVar, \rmd\markVar), \quad
  \ode_{\affDist(\stateVar,\cdot)}(\momentVar) \defeq \int_\vecSpace e^\prj{\momentVar}{\markVar} \affDist(\stateVar, \rmd\markVar)
\end{equation*}
Note that our finiteness assumption (\ref{eq:assumption-affJump-finite}) and our light-tails assumption $\odeSpace = \vecSpace$ (along with Lemma \ref{lemma:odeSpace-rationale}) give us the following properties.
\begin{equation*}
  \overline{\affDist(\stateVar, \cdot)} < \infty, \quad \ode_{\affDist(\stateVar, \cdot)}(\momentVar) < \infty, \quad \stateVar \in \stateSpace
\end{equation*}
We also have local integrability of the following process by our finiteness assumption (\ref{eq:assumption-affJump-finite}).
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:arrivals}
  \N^\X \defeq 1 \ast \jumpMeas^\X
\end{equation}
Note that this is a stronger restriction than local integrability of the compensated jumps
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:jumps}
  \V^\X \defeq \id_\vecSpace \ast \compensate{\jumpMeas^\X},
\end{equation}
which we already have from the special property of $\X$; nonetheless, we intend to use this object as well.
