\begin{proposition}
  \label{proposition:ito-bounded}
  Let $\X$ and $f$ as in Lemma \ref{lemma:ito}, and further impose $f$ is bounded.
  Then the composition $f(\X)$ is a special semimartingale with the decomposition as in (\ref{eq:jump-diffusion-generator}).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \label{proof:proposition:ito-bounded}
  Seeing as $f$ is bounded, \cite[Lemma I.4.24]{jacod2003} tells us that $f(\X)$ is a special semimartingale.
  By \cite[Proposition I.4.23]{jacod2003}, it is then the case that the following term is locally integrable.
  \[
    \Big( f(\X_-+\id_\vecSpace) - f(\X_-) - \Der f(\X_-) \cdot \trunc \Big) \ast \jumpMeas^\X_t
  \]
  By our discussion above, this suffices to conclude (\ref{eq:jump-diffusion-generator}).
\end{proof}
