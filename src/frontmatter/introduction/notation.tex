I want this section to clear up notational similarities and differences with literature.
Namely
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    All the objects one needs for stochastic processes and their stochastic integration.
  \item
    All the spaces one often sees in real analysis.
  \item
    The space, functions, and parameters associated with a given affine process.
\end{itemize}
