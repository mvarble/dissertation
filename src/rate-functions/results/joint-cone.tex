\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:joint-cone}
  The space $\hat\stateSpace$ is a cone in $\hat\vecSpace$ with operations taken componentwise.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \label{proof:lemma:joint-cone}
  This is obvious, as each of the factors $\stateSpace$, $\vecSpace$, $\bbR_+$ that appear in our product is also a cone.
\end{proof}
