\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Cite \cite{kallenberg2002} for the notion of a conditional distribution
  \item
    Establish the convention that each quantity $\X$ on a space $\stateSpace$ will be identitified with the identity map on this space, allowing the nice abuse of notation.
    \[
      \Exp_\mu\big( f(\X) | Y = y \big) = \int_\stateSpace f(\stateVar) \mu_{\X|Y}(\rmd\stateVar | y)
    \]
  \item
    State the definition of a Markov process.
  \item
    State the definition of a time-homogeneous Markov process.
  \item
    State the definition of transition kernel
  \item
    State how transition kernels decide distribution on (weak) path space
  \item
    State the definition of stochastic continuity of a Markov process.
\end{enumerate}
