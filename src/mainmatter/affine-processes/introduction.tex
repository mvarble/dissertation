  Here I put a summary of chapter, along with a short history.
  It will include the following important notes.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Chapter addresses important fundamental results of affine processes.
    \item
      Chapter addresses consequences of results that are important for us, though not specified exactly in any of the literature.
    \item
      Chapter presents the information in an order of increasing complexity of concepts (versus the order in which it is typically proven).
  \end{itemize}
