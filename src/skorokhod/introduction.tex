\begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
  \item
    It is the space which precisely addresses the concerns
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        It is a topology in which $\scrB(\pathSpace{\bbR_+}{\stateSpace})$ agrees with the trace of $\bigotimes_{t\geq0} \scrB(\stateSpace)$ on $\pathSpace{[0,\infty)}{\stateSpace}$
      \item
        It is a Polish space, so we have Prohorov's theorem and conditional distributions.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    The equivalence of tightness and relative compactness extends to the exponential variety.
  \item
    We are using \cite{jacod2003} and \cite{feng2006} for these results.
\end{itemize}
