  Here I put a summary of chapter, along with a short history.
  It will include the following important notes.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Chapter addresses important fundamental results of affine processes.
    \item
      Chapter addresses consequences of mgf results that are important for us, though not specified exactly much in the literature
    \item
      Chapter presents results in full generality, even though we have light-tails assumption; this helps for future extensions.
  \end{itemize}
