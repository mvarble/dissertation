We now turn our focus to the real moments of $(\Prb, \scrF)$ jump-diffusions and the extension of our L\'evy-Khintchine map $\ode$,
\begin{equation*}
  \ode(\momentVar, \stateVar) = \bprj{\momentVar}{\affDrift^\trunc(\stateVar)} + \frac12\bprj{\momentVar}{\affDiff(\stateVar)} + \int_\vecSpace \big( e^\prj{\momentVar}{\markVar} - 1 - \prj{\momentVar}{\trunc(\markVar)} \big) \affJump(\stateVar, \rmd\markVar), 
\end{equation*}
to evaluate real moments $\momentVar \in \vecSpace$.
The above expression may be infinite, as the final term includes an unbounded integral over a possibly infinite measure.
That said, we find it imperative to denote the following sets of finiteness.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:odeSpace-general}
  \odeSpace(\stateVar) \defeq \Big\{ \momentVar \in \vecSpace : \ode(\momentVar, \stateVar) < \infty \Big\}, \qquad
  \odeSpace \defeq \bigcap_{\stateVar \in \stateSpace} \odeSpace(\stateVar)
\end{equation}
The following results will explore the nature of the maps $\ode(\cdot,\stateVar): \odeSpace(\stateVar) \rightarrow \bbR$ for fixed differentiable $\trunc$-characteristics $(\affDrift^\trunc, \affDiff, \affJump)$, where our truncation function $\trunc$ is defined by $\trunc(\markVar) = \markVar 1_{|\markVar|\leq 1}$.
Note that there is no loss of generality in selecting this truncation function, since they all evaluate $\ode$ identically.

As we have seen in Lemmas \ref{lemma:special} and \ref{lemma:countable}, if we have local boundedness of certain integrals of a jump kernel $\affJump$, we can leverage these to $(\Prb, \scrF)$ local conditions of the associated jump-diffusion $\X$.
Throughout the remainder of this section, we impose the following uniform-boundedness principle for the kernel $\affJump$.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:affJump-regularity}
  \begin{aligned}
    &f \in \scrB(\vecSpace)/\scrB(\bbR), ~ \int_\vecSpace |f(\markVar)| \affJump(\stateVar, \rmd\markVar) < \infty \text{ for all } \stateVar \in \stateSpace \\
    &\quad\Longrightarrow\quad \stateVar \mapsto \int_\vecSpace |f(\markVar)| \affJump(\stateVar, \rmd\markVar) \text{ bounded on compact sets}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
With this assumption, we get some nice results on finite exponential moments of $\X$.

In the case that the local martingale in the preceding theorem satisfies sufficient integrability, we are able to introduce a measure change with which the dynamics of $\X$ are still understood.
Note that the following theorem states this, with careful language delineating the fact that special differential characteristics depend on the underlying measure.
