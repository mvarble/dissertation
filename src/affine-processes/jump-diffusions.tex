This section shows how the notions of jump-diffusions explained in Appendix \ref{jump-diffusions} apply in the affine case.
Firstly, we prove the uniform-boundedness property for the affine jump kernel $\affJump$ associated to our affine process.

With this result, we can state succinct versions of the results which exist for general jump-diffusions.
